# FestX: Comprehensive Event Management Platform

## Overview

FestX is a full-stack event management platform built during the NMIMS'24 Hackathon. The platform serves as a comprehensive solution for college festivals and hackathons, enabling seamless event organization, user registration, and real-time notifications. Built with modern web technologies, FestX provides both user and admin interfaces for complete event lifecycle management.

## What Users Can Do

- **Browse Events**: Discover upcoming college festivals, hackathons, and events
- **Event Registration**: Register for events with real-time availability tracking
- **Profile Management**: Create and manage user profiles with event history
- **Real-time Notifications**: Receive instant updates about event changes and announcements
- **Event Details**: Access comprehensive event information including schedules, venues, and requirements
- **Registration Status**: Track registration status and receive confirmation updates
- **Event Timeline**: View chronological timeline of upcoming and past events
- **Search & Filter**: Find events by categories, dates, and popularity

## Admin Features

- **Event Creation**: Create and publish new events with detailed information
- **User Management**: Monitor user registrations and manage participant lists
- **Notification System**: Send targeted notifications to users and event participants
- **Analytics Dashboard**: View registration statistics and event performance metrics
- **Event Moderation**: Edit, update, or cancel events as needed
- **Bulk Operations**: Manage multiple events and users efficiently
- **Registration Tracking**: Real-time monitoring of event sign-ups and capacity management

## Why we Built This

We built FestX to solve the common problems faced during college event management:

- **Scattered Information**: Event details are often spread across multiple platforms
- **Manual Registration**: Traditional paper-based or email registration systems are inefficient
- **Communication Gaps**: Lack of real-time communication between organizers and participants
- **Registration Tracking**: Difficulty in tracking and managing event capacities
- **User Experience**: Poor user experience in discovering and registering for events
- **Admin Overhead**: Manual processes for event creation and participant management

## Tech Stack

### Frontend

- **Next.js**: Full-stack React framework for server-side rendering and API routes
- **TypeScript**: Type-safe development for better code quality
- **Tailwind CSS**: Utility-first CSS framework for rapid UI development
- **Shadcn UI**: Modern component library for consistent design system

### Backend

- **MongoDB**: NoSQL database for flexible data storage
- **Next.js API Routes**: Server-side functionality and REST API endpoints
- **Vercel**: Deployment platform with global CDN and serverless functions
