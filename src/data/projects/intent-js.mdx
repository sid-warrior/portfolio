# Intent JS

Its a revamp of existing website. Created using Next.js, TypeScript, React, Motion, Tailwind CSS, Magic UI, and shadcn ui. For fun it was a simple project to learn about motion and magic ui.

Original website - [tryintent.com](https://tryintent.com/)

> Now the original website looks better than this one. as they updated their website.
