## Why i built this

I built this platform to solve a fundamental issue i faced while studying as follows -

- Professors don't share notes with students.
- Toppers notes are not available to everyone.
- Notes are scattered & not organized.
- Reading one notes and then another notes is a pain with no sync, same example's and tone of writing.
- I don't want to read notes from a pdf, i want to customize my reading experience.

## Tech Stack

- Shadcn UI
- Zod
- React Hook Form
- Razorpay SDK
- Monaco Editor
- MDX Integration

## After launch & Impact

- Got 1700+ users in 2 month.
- Got 200k views in 3 months with average 15k views during exams.
- Got 90+ Premium users in the same duration.
- Learned a lot about SEO, optimization, and how to build a product that is useful for the users.
- Got a lot of feedback from the users, which helped me to improve the platform.
- Finally found a fundamental issue in `velite` that has a memory leak issue, which was causing the platform to be slow.
- Built my own CMS for the platform, which is a custom CMS for the platform.
- Used full potential of MDX and custom components to build the platform.

## Future Plans

- Improve the CMS system to make it more efficient and scalable.
- Add AI Study Assistant
- Scale it to enterprise level.
