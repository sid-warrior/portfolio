## Overview

That Startup is a platform where entrepreneurs can submit ideas and connect with like-minded founders. It's built with Next.js, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, Sanity, and NextAuth.

## Tech Stack

- Next.js
- TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS
- Sanity

It was a fun project to learn about Sanity and NextAuth. It also supports .Md format to write ideas.

I i'm using 'PPR' from nextjs to render the static and dynamic components together. Also using write and real time apis of sanity to update the view count.
